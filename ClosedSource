==================================

Copyright (c) [year] [copyright owner]

IMPORTANT — READ CAREFULLY: This is a license agreement that grants limited,
non-exclusive rights to use the software under the terms below. By receiving,
installing, copying, or otherwise using the software (the "Software"), you
agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree, do not
use the Software.

1. Definitions
--------------
a. "Software" means the copyrighted work identified above, including all
   object code, binaries, libraries, and associated documentation provided by
   the copyright owner.

b. "Source Code" means human-readable form of the Software from which object
   code is generated, including but not limited to original source files,
   build scripts that would reveal source, or any comments and design notes.

c. "Distribute" or "Distribution" means any transfer, publication, sale,
   lease, sublicense, rental, transmission, public performance, or making
   available to third parties.

2. Grant of rights
------------------
Subject to the terms and restrictions of this License, the copyright owner
hereby grants the licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable right to:
   a. Install and execute the Software in object-code/binary form on
      licensee-controlled systems.
   b. Make one (1) archival or backup copy of the Software in object-code
      form solely for the licensee's internal business continuity purposes,
      provided that all copyright and proprietary legends are preserved.

All other rights are reserved by the copyright owner unless expressly granted
in writing.

3. Restrictions (no source distribution; no decompiling)
--------------------------------------------------------
a. No Source Distribution. Except as expressly permitted in writing by the
   copyright owner, the licensee shall not, and shall ensure no third party
   shall, directly or indirectly:
     i. Distribute, publish, transmit, disclose, or otherwise make available
        the Source Code of the Software to any third party in any form;
     ii. Bundle, include, or make available the Source Code within any
        product or package distributed to third parties.

b. No Reverse Engineering or Decompilation. The licensee shall not, and
   shall ensure no third party shall, directly or indirectly, attempt to:
     i. Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, or otherwise
        attempt to derive the Source Code or underlying algorithms and
        logic of the Software from object code, binaries, or other forms of
        the Software; or
     ii. Use tools, services, or processes intended to reconstruct, derive,
         or obtain Source Code from the Software.
   The foregoing restriction is subject to any limitation imposed by
   applicable law that cannot be waived by contract; to the extent such law
   requires reverse engineering or decompilation for interoperability or
   other mandated purposes, that activity is permitted only to the extent
   required by law and the results may not be distributed.

c. No Removal of Proprietary Notices. The licensee must not remove or
   obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices included with
   the Software.

d. No Sublicensing. The licensee may not sublicense the Software except as
   expressly permitted in writing by the copyright owner.

4. Distribution of object code
------------------------------
If the copyright owner expressly permits distribution of object-code
(binaries) under a separate written agreement, any distributed copy of the
object code must include this License and the copyright notice in an
accompanying location (for example, in the same folder as the distributed
binary, in package metadata, or in distribution documentation). Inclusion of
the object code in a larger work does not require the larger work to be
licensed under this License unless expressly stated in writing by the
copyright owner.

5. Attribution and claims of authorship
--------------------------------------
a. You must not misrepresent the origin of the Software. You may not claim
   to be the original author of the Software unless you are.

b. If you create modifications to the Software for your own internal use,
   you must not remove or alter existing author attribution. If you
   distribute a modified binary only with the copyright owner’s written
   permission, you should include a clear statement identifying the
   modifications and their authors.

c. Any false claim of original authorship of the Software is a material
   breach of this License and will result in immediate termination of the
   rights granted hereunder.

6. Patents
----------
No patent rights are granted by implication under this License. Any patent
license, if granted, must be expressly stated in writing by the copyright
owner.

7. Disclaimer of warranty; no warranty unless stated
---------------------------------------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
THAT A WARRANTY IS PROVIDED IN WRITING BY THE COPYRIGHT OWNER. Unless an
express, written warranty is provided by the copyright owner, no warranty is
granted.

8. Limitation of liability and termination
-----------------------------------------
a. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT
   OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR
   THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE, EXCEPT WHERE A WRITTEN
   WARRANTY IS PROVIDED AS STATED IN SECTION 7.

b. Termination. Any violation of Sections 3 or 5 (including unauthorized
   distribution of Source Code, reverse engineering, or false authorship
   claims) shall automatically terminate the rights granted to the violating
   party under this License. Terminated parties must cease use and
   distribution of the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in
   their possession. Termination does not affect recipients who received the
   Software under this License prior to termination.

9. Export controls and compliance
---------------------------------
The licensee shall comply with all applicable export and import laws and
regulations. The licensee agrees not to use or transfer the Software in
violation of any export control or sanctions program.

10. Miscellaneous
-----------------
a. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, the
   remainder of the License shall remain in full force and effect.

b. This License does not limit any rights the copyright owner may have to
   pursue injunctive or other equitable relief for breaches of this License.

c. This License does not change obligations under applicable law (including
   but not limited to consumer protection laws or laws requiring disclosure
   in certain circumstances).
